Reason for Late SubmissionDear grader:This is the project team of Cao Zeyuan and Xiao Kun and we are writing this excuse letter for submitting our project late by one day. Despite a head start and finishing the first two part early this week, we were stuck at kd tree implementation for over two days because this is a new method and we had a hard time dealing with runtime problems. Thus, we needed more time to finish our implementation as well as dealing with finalisation issues like style check. We sincerely thank you for allowing us to slip our submission by one day, as stated on the website, and wish you like our work.ÊBest regards,Zeyuan, Kun
